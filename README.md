# Tic Tac Toe - Donuts and Pretzels

This is my first project for General Assembly Melbourne Web Development Immersive (WDI6)

Written using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

**The Game**
This is a simple tic tac toe, or noughts and crosses, game to be played by two players at the same computer.
To win, a player must get 3 in a row in any direction. 
The game keeps track of multiple rounds, which can be reset to zero at any time.
